*why loops*

Where does asking why lead us to? like infinitely? It depends on the direction but also if one is not going in a loop. We most likely are a part of a very large loop which we can't see where it's looping back. It would be funny if it turned out that the universe loops again and again through the same point and only entity able to remember at that scale is universe itself.
