*Can AI safety really be done without loopholes*

Is there any real world system which don't have loopholes? whether it's personal security, or systems security or industrial security - we were never able to build systems which can effectively be fullproof from holes. So what makes us believe that fragmented systems can be like kept safe and without loop holes?

*thinking before writing as a reconcillation process*

When writing you are forced to think. This is a common experience for everyone who tries to write something. You stare at the cursor and remain paused, breathing in and out. I believe what we call thinking is actually a reconcillation process. From the myriad madness of our thoughts which may appear to be great while thinking we need to bring out a structure (if we are seriously writing). Forcing structure on something needs reconcillation or clarity on what is what and what relates to what. This process takes intention and deep down it's a culmination of asking why and how on every step (which our internal thinking model does automatically). If we were to design a game where rather than laws of physics, the laws of reasoning were running the world - it would be an excellent playground for AI to build that model.
