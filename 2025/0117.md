Can we align superintelligenc?e*

Even if not directly involved, it is a important problem of our time. 5 years or 10 years, that future is coming when we will have a system which is smarter than us in all tasks. How do we actually align such a system?

When it comes to overall humanity, its just better to think it can't be aligned and prepare ourselves. We will be at mercy of whosoever controls, as they will amass wealth and then can drive things in the world directly/indirectly through influence.

So, we will need balancing force. Open source has gone in that direction, but unless we democratise ASI, we will be doomed probably.
