*The parts don't explain the whole*

It's just atoms.
It's just numbers.
It's just emotions.

Do these statements really make any sense? They are reductionist for purely being reductionist? The things made from parts have their own identity and have infinite conceptual depth. The oversimplification does more harm than good in understanding things.
Neiher objects, or people are just sum of their parts. The way they come together allow for existence of a new identity; something that is unique. Predictable doesn't mean lack of individuality.
