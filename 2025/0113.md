*The parts don't explain the whole*

It's just atoms.
It's just numbers.
It's just emotions.

Do these statements really make any sense? They are reductionist for purely being reductionist? The things made from parts have their own identity and have infinite conceptual depth. The oversimplification does more harm than good in understanding things.
Neiher objects, or people are just sum of their parts. The way they come together allow for existence of a new identity; something that is unique. Predictable doesn't mean lack of individuality.

*Ablation teaches about the role of something*

When studying a complex system, there is only one reliable way to really understand what a role of a component is and that is by doing ablation studies. You remove the component and see the effect. Whatever loss of feature happened, was the role of that component. This kind of technique is regularly used in interpretability work on neural networks.
