*machine learning is too much fun to learn why*

Machine learning is more like learning biology. You have a complex system which is working but you cant really explore it deeply due to cost of experimentation. So you learn things by seeing behaviour and building hypothesis. Programming in general is opposite to it. You can check anything about the system. Machine learning is like this weird blend of working with something you write, and after a while you stop understanding it. It's funny almost. It's like you were writing a novel and after a while characters started ot have their own lives and no longer you can understand their intentions.

*the habit pulls you back*

This is my experience with writing habit. Whenever I follow it for a few days, it seems like the habit pulls me back. The feeling of missing a day is a negative reward to brain. But it doesn't happen with all habits I try. Why do some habits have this pulling feature and others don't? For example going to a gym. It doesn't pull you back. I guess it mostly depends on how much quickly you can get started on something. Writing is pretty simple activity and it takes almost zero second from thinking about the habit to doing it.
