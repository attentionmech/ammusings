*the habit pulls you back*

This is my experience with writing habit. Whenever I follow it for a few days, it seems like the habit pulls me back. The feeling of missing a day is a negative reward to brain. But it doesn't happen with all habits I try. Why do some habits have this pulling feature and others don't? For example going to a gym. It doesn't pull you back. I guess it mostly depends on how much quickly you can get started on something. Writing is pretty simple activity and it takes almost zero second from thinking about the habit to doing it.
