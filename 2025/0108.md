*Writing slows down time*

Writing about the day has made me realise that I tend to experience the passage of time more slowly. Many a times earlier I had experienced a week getting passed without any notice and now it feels that just the idea of writing daily makes me realise that there is a "day" cycle. I think it's akin to mindfulness but on a larger scale.
