*Writing slows down time*

Writing about the day has made me realise that I tend to experience the passage of time more slowly. Many a times earlier I had experienced a week getting passed without any notice and now it feels that just the idea of writing daily makes me realise that there is a "day" cycle. I think it's akin to mindfulness but on a larger scale.

*Backing away from the trolly problem*

Recently saw a solution to trolley problem where the AI backs down the trolley slowly. Lot of reactions to that post were like it is genius etc. What is interesting is that even that is how my initial reaction was. Why is that so? We all know that we can stop the trolley and it was never considered as an option given the question was about a hard choice. Is this how the poster wrote about it? 'backing away slowly'. Is this because of the fact that the trolley didn't stop and didn't really get out of the rail constraint - but still managed to avoid loss of life. Seems that way. It managed to do within constraints. Still weird why certain descriptions appear more novel despite doing almost the same thing as trivial case.
