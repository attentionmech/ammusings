*Learning strategies makes a lot of difference*

Too less we think about learning strategies while starting something new. The spectrum seems to be of either people who go deep into meta optimisation of learning strategies or folks who don't care. Different challenges require different kind of learning strategy. Whether you focus on the map or the details, whether you focus on the name or the structure etc. are all choices one makes while studying something but albeit unconsiously.
