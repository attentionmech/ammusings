*Learning strategies makes a lot of difference*

Too less we think about learning strategies while starting something new. The spectrum seems to be of either people who go deep into meta optimisation of learning strategies or folks who don't care. Different challenges require different kind of learning strategy. Whether you focus on the map or the details, whether you focus on the name or the structure etc. are all choices one makes while studying something but albeit unconsiously.

*Are we ever truly free*

We are bound to breathe oxygen so our physical homeostatis does have the final call on what we do. So man is not condemned to be free in the truest sense of it. We don't know what to do with abundance is a more fair assessment. Why many people struggle with abundance is also because it's a different world for them. They don't know what to do in a abundant world - where they don't have to fight to survive. It needs a shift in thinking.

*Good habits are like a operating system*

A good operating system will make your work easier and fun. Life without a operating system is gonna be playing on hard mode. An opaque operating system might give you a decent life but you will not feel meaning. Thoughtful and deliberate habits are the key for changing standard of living and permanence of peace in life.
