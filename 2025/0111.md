*What makes us unable to write longer?*

I have a hypothesis that writing without structural consistency is much easier for anyone. You just let your thoughts go down the paper/editor. Writing of such kind can be done for pages and pages without getting tired. It's as if you are just connecting a funnel from inside of you to the fingers or the tip of the pen. Why does it work like that? what processes makes such writing possible? Writing without thinking - how does it work and how does it work at such a rapid pace. To me it appears as if the process is instinctual and mostly works on token completion like LLMs. I am not putting any deleberate thought but i know what text will go next based on my latent knowledge. I am just converting/linearising what i know about the topic and how i believe the topic is - which can include writing about writing.

Whereas there is another kind of writing. Let's do that now. Think about some ways that Riemann hypothesis can be proved? If you are not directly working on the subject, you will not have any thoughts on this. I challenge you to complete this line with a way to solve Reinmann hypothesis which should be unexplored. I want you to force yourself into really asking your brain and leaving "gap" or "hole" to be filled by your mind. This intention of leaving a hole/gap in the model and letting that tension remain allows for new knowledge to be discovered. It's sort of discovery because it's not already within you. You are relating unrelated concepts and taking bets inside the mind although unconsiously. This is a different process. Hence writing of this nature which is based on discovery of such answers is hard. Anyone can write what they already know from memory or just belief - but it takes lot of tension-building / effort to write something precisely to discover an idea further.
