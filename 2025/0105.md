*Writing is NP-hard*

What would be the complexity of writing? What algorithm we use inside us to convert the non-linear ideas into words. Some ideas are easy to write and others are not. The complex ones need effort to be expressed properly.

*There is no shortage of topics*

Too often we think about what to write about and end up with this false conclusion that most things of relevance have been written. I was wondering about the reason and it seems that we don't want to think new topics. life, tech etc. have some common topics people start exploring for but they don't want to for example write about how the last few sips of tea with a person you met after 2 decades felt. Or how different apps make them feel before sleep or why they are not doing the thing they told they would do. It's just that exploring the unknown in writing is getting uncomfortable. The core to people who don't write is discomfort in exploring new ideas.
