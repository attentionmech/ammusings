This year i have decided to build a habit of writing online. Generally, I explore a lot of cool stuff related to tech, science and philosophy but year on year its easy to forget about all that was explored and mostly remember them as flashes time to time.

Most interseting highlight of previous year has been how much of LLM related tools are now part of my workflow - from generating code, to creating images etc. it seems like we are never going back to the old way of doing things.

The dependency on such tools in my opinion can become very mind-rotting if the quality of work is not improved. If your code is of the same quality with LLMs or if your writing is of the same quality with the writing assistant it just means you are avoiding the work. This has to be avoided.
