This year i have decided to build a habit of writing online. Generally, I explore a lot of cool stuff related to tech, science and philosophy but year on year its easy to forget about all that was explored and mostly remember them as flashes time to time.

Most interseting highlight of previous year has been how much of LLM related tools are now part of my workflow - from generating code, to creating images etc. it seems like we are never going back to the old way of doing things.

The dependency on such tools in my opinion can become very mind-rotting if the quality of work is not improved. If your code is of the same quality with LLMs or if your writing is of the same quality with the writing assistant it just means you are avoiding the work. This has to be avoided.

What defines the quality of an idea? is it how many people know about it? What is novelty of an idea? Mathematics can probably give some KL-divergence answer to it but intuitively a lot of ideas are interesting and they are known to a lot of people and there are lot of dumb ideas too which are known to a very less few so defintely this is not a measure of quality of an idea. then what is? 

Another question is whether quality of thoughts has to do with quality of ideas? it seems so because otherwise how can one come up with good ideas if their thoughts themselves don't live on the same manifold. By manifold i loosely mean the plane over which the thoughts happen. Some people have better thoughts to say than others. Generally, they spend time thinking, reading, questioning etc.

Thought experiment: if i was a thought living amongst other thoughts in a latent space, how would i see the world. Apple is red is relatively less interesting than what? this makes me see that the notion of quality of thoughts is strongly tied to one's taste. someone might find a thought about apple being red more interesting than apple being made up of atoms. "interesting" is as much as a function of observed as much as it is of the observer.

Is a ground breaking idea higher quality than one that is not ground breaking? does quality of an idea has to do with popularity of it? do ideas that talk in meta about other ideas more interesting? 

I am digressing into other thoughts most importantly can my mind be visualised as a bucket of thoughts where i move in a loop? this would do such a nice visual experiment.

If you had free time to do whatever you wanted, what would you do. I believe lot of people ask this question but they don't know themselves enough to even utilise the freetime they have. It's sort of looks like a fallacy. You already have free time, which you are not utilising because there is no scarcity of time but a scarcity of clarity and agency. What you want to do and your will to do it - both are generally lacking in most people.
