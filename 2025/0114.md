*The joy of having good habits*

I dont know what to write about it. It is weird. I have this idea i want to express on this topic, but i don't have the right words. I don't have the structure it needs. But I like the title in itself because it conveys more than probably what i can convey with words. The phenomena of having a gap between what i think i want to write and what words i am able to put together, is quite interesting to me.
