*The joy of having good habits*

I dont know what to write about it. It is weird. I have this idea i want to express on this topic, but i don't have the right words. I don't have the structure it needs. But I like the title in itself because it conveys more than probably what i can convey with words. The phenomena of having a gap between what i think i want to write and what words i am able to put together, is quite interesting to me.

I can explain the joy of having good habits in many ways, but some ways don't fit my taste. I can also write it in a very average and it shall pass some bar, but not the bar of being written by me. what is the psychological process underlying this. Is it somewhat related to intention? how do i intend my mind to convey my taste.
