*building is grokking*

The only way to truly grok something is to build it from scratch. Reading a lot about something doesn't really help much in actually grokking it. If one wants to be a builder of something, then they need to learn it by building.

*second brain for speed-learning*

To get a quicker progress on a new domain it's useful to have a obsidian like second brain with you where you keep organising information and the focus isn't on memorising. Trying to remember things while understanding them slows down the speed at which one can absorb material by a lot, and at the same time its generally quite a bummer as one cannot remember a lot in short amount of time; and the feeling of moving forward without remembering leaves a bad taste. A second brain system should free oneself from the curse of memorisation.

*having no thoughts*

Is it possible for a overthinking to have no thoughts. or is it just their blindness to their own momentory state of mind. Many a times not noticing the thoughts or ideas going through mind can give a impression that we are not overwhelmed with thinking. Thoughts do occupy working memory and it is not noticing/acknowledging them which can lead to this belief that one might otherwise have a poor working memory.
