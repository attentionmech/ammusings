*introspection and meditation*

I used to confuse these two words a lot. meditation and meditative practices generally allow you to calm down your mind and make you reach a good physiological state.
Introspection on the other is probing questions to actually build better understanding and get out of mental roadblocks. both are necessary for ideal regulation.
For example, not defining a goal in life itself is a 'goal' one can be unconsiously following. no amount of meditation will solve it, unless one questions this.
