It's hard to do great things without giving them time. Any kind of value creation needs some better dy/dx then instant reproducible thought. You spend some time on atleast refining the taste. It doesn't need to be lot of manual movement, but just taking time to develop taste is also an effort needed to bring out good from the randomness.
