*are degrees about following a herd*

Recently a lot of discussion happened in tpot about degrees and whether they are really producing real skill. CS engineers not being creative was also one common theme appearing out of it. I think there is some truth to it. The CS work in startups/mncs had been very low quality except in a few places. Most places were just building wrappers of tables with a good design. Hardly, cs engineers really worked on any core ideas and pushed the field forward. So it's not wrong to say that CS folks have been working on the wrong things for major part of the last decade. Nothing wrong with realising it.

*good habits die hard*

We have good habits, it's just we don't realise them. For example, you are not constantly running around the house and banging your head against the wall to reduce your anxiety. That is a good habit. Many don't have this. Question is how to attain arbitrary habits which meet goals we set for ourselves. That is the thing which people want. One wants a habit which allow them to become who they want to be not just any habits which they inherited from their home.
