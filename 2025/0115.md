*good habits die hard*

We have good habits, it's just we don't realise them. For example, you are not constantly running around the house and banging your head against the wall to reduce your anxiety. That is a good habit. Many don't have this. Question is how to attain arbitrary habits which meet goals we set for ourselves. That is the thing which people want. One wants a habit which allow them to become who they want to be not just any habits which they inherited from their home.
