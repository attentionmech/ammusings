How much of advices/improvements can one integrate in their life. From thousands of years people are advicing on how to live life and lot of those books (religious, self-help, stoic etc.) are still being read as a source of inspiration on how to live life, if not as a gospel

The best fiction when someone will look back from tomorrow is between us, but we don't know about it. This is true for many other things not only fiction. Ideas, works etc. which get popularity much later in timeline are limited to a niche group in their own timeline.

This reminds me of a joke which regularly reappears on internet - that what if i didn't sold my bitcoins. People who help bitcoin by intention should be studied given how much of an asset it was at that time.
