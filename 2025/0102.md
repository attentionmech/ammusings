How much of advices/improvements can one integrate in their life. From thousands of years people are advicing on how to live life and lot of those books (religious, self-help, stoic etc.) are still being read as a source of inspiration on how to live life, if not as a gospel

The best fiction when someone will look back from tomorrow is between us, but we don't know about it. This is true for many other things not only fiction. Ideas, works etc. which get popularity much later in timeline are limited to a niche group in their own timeline.

This reminds me of a joke which regularly reappears on internet - that what if i didn't sold my bitcoins. People who help bitcoin by intention should be studied given how much of an asset it was at that time.

Most of us only know to work and produce output with external reward. We don't accept our dependence on it but it is precisely the reason why most people product almost zero significant work in their life. It is because doing something creative for yourself has to be done firstly for it's own reward as it's value at first is zero in front of others.

It is also easy to fall in trap of weak rewards. Rewards which allow you to just do enough to survive. A paycheck for one is a weak reward. It just lets you have enough to meet your needs and keeps you maximally occupied in the job cycle. This can take away crucial years of your life. The society is designed in this way so that productivity at mass scale can be maintained.

A recent epiphany left me silent. Words are connected to intentions, hence they have so much power. an hour of silence vs an hour of asking yourself "why" repeatedly on ideas you are curious about have a drastic divergence in how changed you feel afterwards.

What will the society look like in future. Are there books today which look into future correctly? Are there any predicted technologies which have yet to appear. Was bitcoin predicted? Were large language models predicted by any fictional book? More likely the novelists/writers talk more about stories that emerge out of status quo and interactions than actually how things work. Science deals with how things work, whereas Fiction deals with purely imaginitive space. Science is rigorous and asks questions. Fiction freely assumes. This also shows sides of human psyche. We can reason things and we can keep assumptions and move forward freely in domain of fiction.

LLMs are stochastic parrots. May be at some level we humans are too. But the process of writing has lot of pauses where I go into imagination and refine my taste. It's not just regurgiating what i know but also learning what i know and what i need to know. Writing for humans is not just dumping of what we know but exploration of what we know and most of the time we end up improving our understanding. I think this kind of cycle of refinement gives writing it's unique quality which people tend to notice and feel attracted to.
